OCR to Extract Details from Image/Label :

Algorithm:
Image Preprocessing:

Convert the image to grayscale to simplify further operations.
Apply thresholding or adaptive thresholding for binarization (black and white image).
Use noise reduction techniques like Gaussian blur or morphological transformations (e.g., opening or closing).
Text Region Detection:

Use contours or bounding boxes to find regions in the image where text is likely present.
OCR Extraction:

Use an OCR library like Tesseract to recognize text from the image.

Procedure:
Capture the image (or load from a file).
Preprocess the image to make text more recognizable.
Pass the preprocessed image to an OCR engine like Tesseract.
Extract and display the detected text.
