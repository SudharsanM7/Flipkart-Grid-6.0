Detecting Freshness of Fresh Produce:

Algorithm:
Visual Indicators:

Use color analysis to determine the freshness of fruits or vegetables. Fresh produce typically has brighter colors, while decayed or older produce will show discoloration.
Extract features such as color histogram, texture, and spots to differentiate between fresh and stale produce.
Temperature, Weight, and Moisture Detection:

For higher accuracy, use IR cameras or multispectral sensors to assess moisture content or temperature to detect freshness.
Use a machine learning model to classify produce based on training data of fresh vs. spoiled produce.

Procedure:
Collect training data with images of fresh and decayed produce.
Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, CNN) to classify the produce based on features like color, texture, and shape.
For more accuracy, use additional sensors (temperature, moisture) to enhance predictions.

theory :
Fresh produce can be detected by using sensory testing, which involves using the human senses to evaluate the produce's physical properties. Here are some ways to check the freshness of produce: 
Color
High quality produce is rich in color and has little to no discoloration. For example, tomatoes should be deep red, and bananas should have a bright yellow peel. 
Firmness
High quality produce is firm to the touch. For example, fruits like apples and oranges should be firm without any soft spots. 
Smell
High quality produce doesn't have an unpleasant odor. However, smell doesn't play a big factor in a vegetable's freshness, although anything that smells overly sweet or sour is likely passed its prime. 
Texture
High quality produce is crisp. For example, lettuce and spinach should feel crisp, not limp. 
The accuracy of sensory testing is affected by the detector's sensory organs, experience, emotions, and the detecting environment. Different inspectors may also have different standards for freshness, which can lead to inconsistent results.
