Image Recognition and IR-Based Counting:

Algorithm:
Image Recognition:

Use a pre-trained deep learning model like YOLO or MobileNet for object detection.
Identify the desired object (e.g., counting specific items like fruits or vegetables).
IR-Based Counting:

Use IR sensors placed on the conveyor belt or in front of the object detection system.
When the IR sensor detects an object passing through, increase the count.

Procedure:
Implement object detection using YOLO or another detection model.
Set up an IR sensor to detect when an object passes through.
Increment the count each time an object is detected by both the IR sensor and the object recognition model.
